# TTF-Estimator
Matlab app that estimates time to task failure based on end-test torque (ET) and torque-impulse above ET (both values acquired through 5-min all-out test following Burnley et al., 2009).

"Contraction (s)" and "Rest (s)" refers to the duty cycle durations of the experimental task (most common is 3s contraction to 2s rest).

Fill out all the five numerical fields, then press "Estimate TTF".
